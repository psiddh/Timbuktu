# Timbuktu

Create Context-Aware Android Application around user pictures and videos.

Inspiration
Simple and intuitive way to look back at all my previous travels (say on a Mobile device)

How it works
Android based mobile application that could use any context-aware platforms (SDKs) out there, at its heart to 
compile a beautiful story blended nicely with simple UI interfaces.

Challenges I ran into
Few! Most prominent of them is to merge the two data sets (meta-data available on Android) and context-aware SDK
service provided information and display in the most intuitive manner.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Since this idea / app is still work-in-progress, we would be proud once we have the application out in the manner we 
originally conceived. Open for collaboration.

What I learned
Plenty! One thing I'd say is that building a fairly cool UI requires lot of craft and clear thinking (on Android). 
Please note that our UI is still work-in-progress and hope to ready soon.

What's next for Timbuktu
Ability to integrate with Android's 'nearby' APIs.
Introduce Local-Social angle to the application
And few more...
